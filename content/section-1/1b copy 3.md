You've decided to look at what is happening globally using the NextStrain website. You can find a tree based on this stage of the early pandemic <a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/tutorial?c=country&m=div"  target="_blank">here</a>.

Spend some time exploring the tree, and the options available on Nextstrain. You can:

- Dive into the tree
- Colour by different options
- Experiment with different layout types
- Use clock mode to see how the date of genomes corresponds to the number of mutations they have from the original virus as it spilled over into humans and estimate the clock rate
- In fact this tree has been pre-processed with a molecular clock approach, to estimate dates of the internal nodes so you can switch to "Time mode". However for these exercises we recommend primarily using the "divergence" mode, as "time" in Nextstrain makes guesses to resolve polytomies, which can be misleading.

Use the filtering function to find the sequence `Australia/VIC295/2020` and zoom in on its context. You may want to toggle the filter on and off with the eye icon to see the context of the sequence.

One reason you've come to Nextstrain is because you want to understand whether the mutation you've seen in your patient, `S:D614G` has occurred in other patients. To look into this, colour the tree by genotype at the S:614 position.

According to the time tree, at what sort of date did this mutation first occur?
